# Magnet Duet
Magnet Duet is a puzzle platformer where you overcome obsticals using your magnetic pair.

## Setup
We followed this [guide](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_windows.html) to setup our deveopment environment for windows.

We built using Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 (16.11.1). MonoGame was installed using Visual Studio's NuGet Package Manager.

## Importing art assets
Installing MonoGame using Visual Studio's NuGet Package Manager will also install the MGCB Editor (MonoGame Content Builder). This is the asset management system for MonoGame. To import an art asset, open this software, click "add existing asset", and build the assets once everything has been imported.

## Install
The executable comes in a folder with all the required dependencies. To execute, first extract the folder and then run Rapid_Prototyping_T7.exe
